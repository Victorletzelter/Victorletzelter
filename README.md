# Hello, welcome to my github repository ! 

I am a student with a passion for mathematics and its applications, especially in artificial intelligence (deep learning, reinforcement learning, computational statistics, image processing, NLP).
Open-minded and social, I am interested in other disciplines, especially statistical physics and market finance.

Feel free to discover my favorites personnal or group projects in my repositories.
I am open to discussion.
